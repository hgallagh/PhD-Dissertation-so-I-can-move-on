\subsection{Well going into it}
I did a statistics project that was planned for imagine RIT (obviously canceled) for other aspects. The article had something alluding to the idea that okay this thing is going to happen..."You're likely to get covid" \\ 
\section{1.9.2022}
I honestly have less interest of being with people lately. I'm not playing games. I mean I basically claimed "mental health issues" when I wrote a dissertation and book since I didn't like anyone at the school I was at and know that I'm serving my karma there.
\\
Looking for remote jobs since I've always been more technical anyways it's really your confidence and how much you know that you can work for other people and not just for yourself and still have skills that you can be consulted for. 
\\ 
I want funding to attend conferences. I need grants. \\
I think I deserve to work at somewhere like google or harvard, but at the very least I can act like what I think someone would do. 
\\ 
In other news I'm happy when I'm not near my parents. I do not need that guilt complex of what I'm not doing I can help them when I'm available.
