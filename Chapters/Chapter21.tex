This is my budget. so I have 5k in my name and then 3k for the math modeling course. \\ 

3k that could have been used for getting rid of my tattoo... 

Any interview I plan on acting like a masters to phD grad student. I have the papers and credentials and I refuse to feel bad about it. \\ 
My plan is to work on this in the meantime with my book during the great resignation and before my parents guilt me into any other responsibilities around quitting or something stupid like friends or life balance. This is my dreams finally coming true that 
I never had the opportunity to do until now. 
I do not know anything about what a DAP is and I do not know what webinars I can attend. \\
I desperately need an A in this course and I need to do the assignments and proofs now before anyone like my parent's emotions and friends whatever getting in the fucking way or worse me just caving and wanting money after all of this. I did all of this for an education while my cost of living is clearly low.
