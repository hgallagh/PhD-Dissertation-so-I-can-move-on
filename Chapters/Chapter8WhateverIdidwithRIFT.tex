\chapter{This is for RIFT BHNS LIGO things that I'll probably omit}

What have I even been doing. Running some black hole neutron star simulation for two years. 

\section[Shorter Title]{We're here to talk about proofs right?}



\subsection{Suppose this you plebeians}

I own two whiteboards in my apartment and should be respected as such. At first it was a motivational thing when I was depressed to keep on with everything...just to be patient sort of thing and that if I read enough of the papers and publishing I would understand enough to do it myself. 

\subsubsection{Subsubsections, the final formatted heading}

How many times did I have to take this course to be like (respectfully) fuck you I can write these proofs on my own?

\section{The Angst of the Incomplete with undergrads}
