\chapter{Chapter 12 The burden of being an inspiration and role model in a pandemic}

\section{Who knows I just kept running and cooked and was happily antisocial}
I networked with my friends and played kickball and had a problem with that from them not inviting more girls which is part of the diversity issue. I still had the same amount of work and desires. Yet if I flaked it would be a problem. In this example it was kickball, but I was also pointed out as other. Of course I still want to be on the team, but it should not be my job to get more girls and it should not be my job to deal with me being bad at catching when I was tired. This bias needs to stop. Am I clingly to the program of course.
