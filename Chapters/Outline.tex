\chapter{This is the outline}

For all of the podcasts and whatever I've done please get out of my way. 

I want to remember math modeling how it came to be from photons and the different courses I took on singularities and metasurfaces. 


Not letting blind circumstance dictate my life. Yes I'm undercover as an undergraduate student and it's to my advantage while I write my book on all the math and physics I know and code of course. Then how well I can edit. 


While I'm waiting for these dumbasses to know how much I've been holding back based on professionalism and being insecure. I'm staying up tonight since I need to take advantage of the great resignation and get a job. I will need money in the meantime and to write scholarships and to ghost anyone like Cailin since they do not support my long range goals of a nobel prize or any kind of research or grant award. Skin care is expensive so I need to do this so I can move on with my life. Everyday that I don't wake up at somewhere like Georgetown is a travesty.
