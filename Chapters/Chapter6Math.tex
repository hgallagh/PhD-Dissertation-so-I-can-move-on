\chapter{Initial discoveries}

(This is where I talk about my initial ideas and interests when I was younger and all the Flubber scientist things.) Astronomy projects with my dad and everything. 
I learned about the optics program in my AP physics program. This is where I was introduced to the concepts of the angle of incidence and Snell's Law. 

\section[Shorter Title]{RIT was my karma so I had to study Fourier Analysis in the mean time}



\subsection{Well I understand it now since I read osa/optica papers every day and looked up what I didn't know}

I own two whiteboards in my apartment and should be respected as such. At first it was a motivational thing when I was depressed to keep on with everything...just to be patient sort of thing and that if I read enough of the papers and publishing I would understand enough to do it myself. 

\subsubsection{Subsubsections, the final formatted heading}

Now I actually have skill in these subjects out of the pressure to perform and honestly my network is full of men so I need to put them in their place. 

\section{A Second Section}

I studied astrophysics because my ex broke my heart. As the TSwizzle song goes...I bet you think about me. "Oh my god she's insane she wrote a astrophysics/optics thesis about me. I bet you think about me." That's how it goes right?
